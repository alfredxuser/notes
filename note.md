Tip for Dropbox: alter the ending URL so it finishes with "?raw=1" to ensure the images embed as you are expecting. By default, the url will end with "?dl=0". You will need to replace "?dl=0" with "?raw=1"

Tip for Google Drive: use this link format instead of the publicly accessible link Google generates: ![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12F2orB50fZJa0aXl-FnBQRSp_HJL04Qn)
