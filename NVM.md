```bash
 # Option 1
 curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash

 # Option 2
 wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash
```

If curl desn't works for you, use wget. But if you fail, before to get angry you need to know in linux you need to do a lot of stuff manually, just read and you will have succes. So I'm trying to tell you, install curl and wget just typing in your terminal...

```bash
 $ sudo apt install wget
 
 $ sudo apt install curl
```
